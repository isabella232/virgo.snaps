			Using @snaps.product.name@, or @snaps.product.name.short@ for short, you can construct a web application from multiple OSGi 
			bundles, each of which serves up content for a distinct sub-portion of your application's URL space. @snaps.product.name.short@ 
			applications are arranged in a parent/child structure, with each application having at most one top-level parent, and zero or more 
			children/grand children and so on. Parents are referred to as the hosts, children as snaps.

			Here you see that any <literal>HTTP</literal> requests for '/app' will be dealt with by the host bundle while '/app/orders' 
			and '/app/billing' will be dealt with by their respective snaps bundles. Each host/snap can use completely different web technologies 
			to deal with the requests, @snaps.product.name.short@ places no restrictions on your choices. The developer decides how to split 
			the application up and how closely to couple the host and various snaps. @snaps.product.name.short@ has been designed to be as 
			un-invasive as possible while still making it easy to share information between the host and its snaps.
