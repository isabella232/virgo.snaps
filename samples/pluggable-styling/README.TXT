SpringSource Snaps Pluggable Styling Sample
--------------------------------------------

The sample is made up of three war projects:

 - styled-host
 - green-style-snap
 - plain-style-snap

Each project can be build by moving into its directory and running ant jar. This will result in a
.war file being created in the projects target/artifacts directory.

Before deploying the host and one of its snaps to dm Server the Snaps subsystem must have been
installed. Please refer to

details.
